1. For the first scenario. The php script queries an exact value and returns all the column values for that row.
   All the data related to that user is visible now
2. The query returned the same values as if the name was passed normally. It didn't affect at all that the search
   parameters had extra characters in it. My guess would be that there was not any difference from point 1 since the single
   quote closed the query string so MySQL ignored the rest.
3. I expected the query to return all the rows in the table. However, this was not the case since I have single quotes 
   around the varible inside the php script. This was the only way i could make the script to return the correct values.
