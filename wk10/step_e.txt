I fixed the first problem by scanning if the length of the array returned by scandir() was greater than 3 which means
that the get parameter wanted to access a directory outside the current one also by checking that the last index of that
array was not equal to 'html'

I fixed the second problem by checking if the filename passed existed in the application structure. If it didnt I would
I would restrict the access.
